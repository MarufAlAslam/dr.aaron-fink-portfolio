                        Using a developmental biopsychosocial framework, Dr. Fink does a thorough and careful assessment
                        of new patients. In addition to interviewing the parents and child or adolescent, the evaluation
                        process frequently includes rating scales completed by parents, teachers and /or the child. He
                        will also review previous evaluations (e.g. psychoeducational, language or neurological reports)
                        if they are available. If appropriate, medical tests (e.g. blood tests, MRI, sleep study),
                        consultation with other medical specialists (e.g. neurologist, cardiologist) or psychological
                        testing will be recommended.
                        <br><br>
                        In evaluating children, Dr. Fink typically first meets with the parents to gather a detailed
                        history. He then meets with the child. The meeting with the child typically includes an
                        interview, drawing and play. The final step of the evaluation process involves meeting with the
                        parents to provide feedback and recommendations.
                        <br><br>
                        In evaluating adolescents, Dr. Fink typically first meets with the adolescent and parents
                        together rather than first meeting with just parents. The adolescent is also given an
                        opportunity to meet alone with Dr. Fink. This process strengthens the alliance with both the
                        adolescent and their parents and minimizes the frequent adolescent concern that the psychiatrist
                        is the parents’ agent to control them. Depending on the nature of the adolescent’s problems, the
                        evaluation process will occur over one to three appointments.

                        of the athlete. In addition to interviewing the athlete and collateral sources (e.g. coaches,
                        trainers) when appropriate, the evaluation process frequently includes questionnaires and rating
                        scales completed by the athlete. He will also review previous evaluations (e.g.
                        psychoeducational, language and neurological reports) if they are available. If appropriate, Dr.
                        Fink will recommend medical tests (e.g. blood tests, MRI, sleep studies), consultation with
                        other medical specialists (e.g. neurologist, cardiologist) or psychological testing.

                        <b>About Group Therapy</b> <br><br>
                        Group psychotherapy is a special form of therapy in which a small group of people meet together
                        under the guidance of a professionally trained therapist to help themselves and one another.
                        Group psychotherapy is widely used and has been a standard treatment option for over 50 years.
                        <br>
                        Children exist in group environments-their families, schools, and organized activities. These
                        are the environments in which they grow and develop as human beings. Group psychotherapy is no
                        different. It provides a place where children and adolescents can come together with others to
                        share problems or concerns, to better understand their own situation, and to learn from and with
                        each other. <br>
                        Group therapy helps children and adolescents learn about themselves and improve their
                        interpersonal relationships. It addresses feelings of isolation, depression and anxiety. It
                        helps children make significant changes so they feel better about themselves. <br>
                        Group therapy works! In studies comparing group psychotherapy to individual therapy, group
                        therapy has been shown to be as effective and sometimes more effective. In cases of medical
                        illness, there is substantial evidence that this form of therapy help people cope better with
                        their illness and enhance the quality of their lives. <br><br>

                        <b>Commonly Asked Questions</b> <br><br>
                        How does group therapy work? <br>
                        The group therapist selects people (usually 5 to 8) who would be helped by the group experience
                        and who can be learning partners for one another. In the group meetings, patients are encouraged
                        to talk with each other in a spontaneous and honest fashion. The therapist provides productive
                        examination of the issues or concerns affecting the individuals and the group by guiding the
                        discussion. <br> <br>

                        If someone is in group, do they also need individual therapy? <br>
                        It depends on the individual. Sometimes group therapy is used as the only treatment approach.
                        Sometimes it is used along with individual therapy and/or family therapy. Often children and
                        adolescents find that working simultaneously in more than one therapy stimulates growth in
                        mutually complementary ways. <br><br>

                        How is group therapy different from support groups? <br>
                        Under the guidance of a professional, group therapy focuses on interpersonal relationships.
                        Group therapy also provides children and adolescents an opportunity to work on specific problems
                        or challenges. The psychotherapy group is different from support in that it not only helps
                        people cope with their problems, but also provides an opportunity for change and growth. Support
                        groups help people cope with difficult situations at various times, but are usually geared
                        toward alleviating symptoms, but not growth. <br><br>

                        Why is group therapy useful? <br>
                        Joining a group is useful because it provides opportunities to learn with and from other people.
                        Children and adolescents learn to understand their own patterns of thought and behavior and
                        those of others. In group therapy, people learn that perhaps they are not as different as they
                        think or that they are not alone. Your child also has an opportunity to increase self-esteem by
                        helping others. <br><br>

                        Will there be people with similar problems in my child’s group? <br>
                        Part of the therapist's role is to evaluate each member’s problems prior to having them join the
                        group. Usually there is a mix of members who can learn from each other. While some members will
                        have similar circumstances, it is not necessary for all to be dealing with exactly the same
                        problem. In fact, individuals with different strengths and difficulties are often in the best
                        position to help one another. <br><br>

                        What kind of commitment do we need to make? <br>
                        The time commitment depends on the type of group and the nature and extent of your child’s
                        problems. Short-term groups devoted to specific, concrete issues may last anywhere from 6 to 20
                        weeks. In open-ended groups, children and adolescents work at their own pace and leave when
                        their particular needs or goals have been met. <br><br>

                        What if my child is uncomfortable discussing personal problems in front of others?
                        It is not unusual to feel uneasy or embarrassed when first joining a group, but children and
                        adolescents quickly begin to develop feelings of trust. Most patients find that group therapy
                        provides a great deal of relief because it allows them a chance to talk with others who are
                        experiencing similar problems-in a private, safe, confidential setting. <br><br>

                        Who Can Benefit? <br>
                        Like individual therapy, group psychotherapy can benefit almost anyone. Some of the issues
                        typically addressed include: <br><br>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Difficulties with interpersonal relationships</li>
                        <li>Depression and anxiety</li>
                        <li>Coping with medical illness</li>
                        <li>Loss</li>
                        <li>Trauma</li>

                        The Group Therapy Session <br>
                        The group therapy session is a collaborative effort in which the therapist assumes clinical
                        responsibility for the group and its members. In a typical session, members work to express
                        their own problems, feelings, ideas, and reactions freely and honestly as possible. Playing ,
                        drawing, building and pretending, as well as talking are important ways of sharing feelings and
                        resolving problems for children. Adolescent groups rely primarily, if not exclusively, on verbal
                        communication. Such exploration gives the group important information needed to understand and
                        help one another. Members learn not only to understand themselves and their own issues, but also
                        become “therapeutic helpers” for other members

                        <b>About Group Therapy</b> <br><br>
                        Group psychotherapy is a special form of therapy in which a small group of people meet together
                        under the guidance of a professionally trained therapist to help themselves and one another.
                        Group psychotherapy is widely used and has been a standard treatment option for over 50 years.
                        <br>
                        Children exist in group environments-their families, schools, and organized activities. These
                        are the environments in which they grow and develop as human beings. Group psychotherapy is no
                        different. It provides a place where children and adolescents can come together with others to
                        share problems or concerns, to better understand their own situation, and to learn from and with
                        each other. <br>
                        Group therapy helps children and adolescents learn about themselves and improve their
                        interpersonal relationships. It addresses feelings of isolation, depression and anxiety. It
                        helps children make significant changes so they feel better about themselves. <br>
                        Group therapy works! In studies comparing group psychotherapy to individual therapy, group
                        therapy has been shown to be as effective and sometimes more effective. In cases of medical
                        illness, there is substantial evidence that this form of therapy help people cope better with
                        their illness and enhance the quality of their lives. <br><br>

                        <b>Commonly Asked Questions</b> <br><br>
                        How does group therapy work? <br>
                        The group therapist selects people (usually 5 to 8) who would be helped by the group experience
                        and who can be learning partners for one another. In the group meetings, patients are encouraged
                        to talk with each other in a spontaneous and honest fashion. The therapist provides productive
                        examination of the issues or concerns affecting the individuals and the group by guiding the
                        discussion. <br> <br>

                        If someone is in group, do they also need individual therapy? <br>
                        It depends on the individual. Sometimes group therapy is used as the only treatment approach.
                        Sometimes it is used along with individual therapy and/or family therapy. Often children and
                        adolescents find that working simultaneously in more than one therapy stimulates growth in
                        mutually complementary ways. <br><br>

                        How is group therapy different from support groups? <br>
                        Under the guidance of a professional, group therapy focuses on interpersonal relationships.
                        Group therapy also provides children and adolescents an opportunity to work on specific problems
                        or challenges. The psychotherapy group is different from support in that it not only helps
                        people cope with their problems, but also provides an opportunity for change and growth. Support
                        groups help people cope with difficult situations at various times, but are usually geared
                        toward alleviating symptoms, but not growth. <br><br>

                        Why is group therapy useful? <br>
                        Joining a group is useful because it provides opportunities to learn with and from other people.
                        Children and adolescents learn to understand their own patterns of thought and behavior and
                        those of others. In group therapy, people learn that perhaps they are not as different as they
                        think or that they are not alone. Your child also has an opportunity to increase self-esteem by
                        helping others. <br><br>

                        Will there be people with similar problems in my child’s group? <br>
                        Part of the therapist's role is to evaluate each member’s problems prior to having them join the
                        group. Usually there is a mix of members who can learn from each other. While some members will
                        have similar circumstances, it is not necessary for all to be dealing with exactly the same
                        problem. In fact, individuals with different strengths and difficulties are often in the best
                        position to help one another. <br><br>

                        What kind of commitment do we need to make? <br>
                        The time commitment depends on the type of group and the nature and extent of your child’s
                        problems. Short-term groups devoted to specific, concrete issues may last anywhere from 6 to 20
                        weeks. In open-ended groups, children and adolescents work at their own pace and leave when
                        their particular needs or goals have been met. <br><br>

                        What if my child is uncomfortable discussing personal problems in front of others?
                        It is not unusual to feel uneasy or embarrassed when first joining a group, but children and
                        adolescents quickly begin to develop feelings of trust. Most patients find that group therapy

                        experiencing similar problems-in a private, safe, confidential setting. <br><br>

                        Who Can Benefit? <br>
                        Like individual therapy, group psychotherapy can benefit almost anyone. Some of the issues
                        typically addressed include: <br><br>
